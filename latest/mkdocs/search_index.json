The version downloaded along with the package is the latest release found \nhere\n. It follows the \ndev\n branch of STINGER.\n\n\n\n\nCustom STINGER version\n\n\nIf you wish to use a different version of STINGER, you can set the environment variable \nSTINGER_LIB_PATH\n with the path to the folder containing the shared library \nlibstinger_core\n and \nlibstinger_alg\n.\n\n\n\n\nGuide\n\n\n\n\nThe Stinger type\n\n\nThe Stinger type can be used to create a new STINGER data structure. Due to the use of variable length attributes in the C STINGER data structure, we are unable to use a Julia type to directly map to a STINGER type (http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/#struct-type-correspondences). So we use the C pointer handle to interact with the STINGER library in the implementation.\n\n\n\n\nCreating STINGER graphs\n\n\njulia\n s = Stinger() # Creates a new STINGER\nStingerGraphs.Stinger(Ptr{Void} @0x000000012317e000)\n\n\n\n\nWe have registered finalizers with Julia that automatically frees your STINGER data structure, the next time the GC runs after it goes out of scope.\n\n\n\n\nAdding and Removing edges\n\n\nUse the \ninsert_edge!\n and \nremove_edge!\n to add and remove edges respectively.

Uses the  kcore_find  function exposed by the C STINGER library. Returns the labels and the counts as two  Vector{Int64} s.  source  #  StingerGraphs.kcore     Method .  kcore(s::Stinger)  This version is slower as it makes a call to  stinger_max_active_vertex , which is sequential and runs through every vertex in the graph. If you know the maximum number of active vertices, call  kcore(s, nv)  which is faster.  source  #  StingerGraphs.kronecker     Method .  kronecker(\n    scale::Int64,\n    edgefactor::Int64;\n    a::Float64=0.57,\n    b::Float64=0.19,\n    c::Float64=0.19\n)  Generates edges for a Kronecker generator graph. Returns an array of 2 rows with 1st being the start edge and 2nd row having the end edge.  source  #  StingerGraphs.outdegree     Method .  outdegree(s::Stinger, src::Int64)  Returns the outdegree of vertex index.  source  #  StingerGraphs.remove_edge!     Method .  remove_edge!(s::Stinger, etype::Int64, from::Int64, to::Int64)  Removes the edge of type  etype  from  from  to  to  from the STINGER graph  s . Raises an error in the edge was not found or if there was an error while removing the edge.  source  #  StingerGraphs.remove_edges!     Method .  remove_edges!(s::Stinger, edges::AbstractArray, numedges::Integer)  Removes  numedges  from the STINGER graph  s . Input format is 5\u00d7numedges (etype, src, dst, weight, times) to make consistent with  insert_edges! . Only the  src ,  dst  and  etype  fields matter.  source  #  StingerGraphs.stingerconfig     Method .  stingerconfig(\n    nv, nebs=0, netypes=0, nvtypes=0, memory_size=0, no_map_none_etype=0,\n    no_map_none_vtype=0, no_resize=0)  Creates a  StingerConfig .  source  #  Base.getindex     Method .  getindex(x::Stinger, field::StingerFields)  Obtain value of a field from the Stinger data structure. For  batch_time  and  update_time , use  get_batchtime  and  get_updatetime  respectively.  source  #  Base.setindex!     Method .  setindex!(x::Stinger, val, field::StingerFields)  Set value of a field from the Stinger data structure.  source  #  StingerGraphs.loadstingergraph     Method .  loadstingergraph(s::Stinger)  Use this to get a  StingerGraph  representation of your  Stinger  graph. This representation will not be kept in sync with the graph. If you make changes, you will need to call this again to load the graph with the new attributes.  source  #  StingerGraphs.storageptr     Method .  storageptr(s::Stinger)  Get a pointer to the storage array of the STINGER data structure  source",
